##### Zeno's Paradoxa

Achilles will never overtake the tortoise, but: an infinite sum of numbers close to zero can be finite.
The standing arrow, but: an infinite sum of numbers close to zero can be positive.

##### Littlewood's Principles

Every measurable set is nearly a finite union of intervals.
Every measurable function is nearly continuous.
Every convergent sequence of measurable functions is nearly uniformly convergent.


Consider a closed interval 
$A = [a, b]\subset \mathbb{R}$ . 
A *partition of A* is an increasing sequence $\left\{x_1, x_2, \text{..} ,x_n\right\}$ 
with $a = x_1$,  $b = x_n$. Its granularity is $\max \left\{\left.x_k-x_{k-1}\right|k=1,\text{..},n\right\}$. 
A *step function* is constant on the intervals  $\left[x_{k-1}, x_k\right]$. 
It is clear that the sum of two step functions is again a step function and 
the same is true for the product of a step function with a scalar. 
So the step functions on an interval form a vector space $\mathcal{S}[a, b]$ . 
The integral of a step function $\phi$ on [a, b] is defined as


$\int :\phi \rightarrow \int_a^b \phi (x) \, dx$
