# First Steps in Arithmetic



## Introduction

Some introductory material on calculus

**Why read this?** Because it packages the essentials—definitions, theorems, and proofs—so that each statement is both conceptually transparent 
and algorithmically actionable. Readers who enjoy precise reasoning and also care about computation (e.g., implementing `%`, `//`, modular inverses, 
or CRT in code) will find a compact, self-contained route from first principles to tools that power modern applications in cryptography, coding theory, 
and computational mathematics.
